Hello there!

If you are reading here, congratulations for your ConsTech interest!
In this repository, while I work for Hacettepe University & EnSensei Engineering and Consulting Inc., you can see the Arduino (mostly Uno) and obviously C++ workshops for ConsTech working areas.
You can always contact to me!
Best regards,
GK
